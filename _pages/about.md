I am **Michał Tyrolski**, a *Senior AI Consultant* at **Ernst & Young**. I hold an **M.Sc. in Machine Learning** (2023) and a **B.Sc. in Computer Science** (2021) from the **University of Warsaw**, where I was supervised by prof. Marek Cygan and prof. Piotr Miłoś.

My research focuses on **Multi-Agent Systems**, **Meta-RL**, **AI-based Planning**, and **decision-making in complex environments**. My expertise includes offline and online reinforcement learning, planning, efficient transformers, and LLMs. I have contributed to AI projects at **Microsoft**, **Nvidia**, **Deepflare**, and **Samsung**.

I am an active member of the AI community, particularly with **ML in PL**, where I have been an organizer since 2020. In my free time, I enjoy mountain hiking and motorization. For more details on my experience, please visit my *CV* page.
