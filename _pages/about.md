I am Michał Tyrolski, a Senior AI Consultant at Ernst & Young, working on multi-agent systems with reasoning. I graduated with honors in 2023 from the University of Warsaw, holding an M.Sc. in Machine Learning and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the same institution, completed in 2021.

My experience encompasses offline RL/IL for planning in combinatorial reasoning problems, online RL with sparse rewards, efficient transformers, and LLMs in general. My research interests include Multi-Agent systems, Meta-RL, AI-based Planning, and decision-making in complex environments. I have had the privilege of working with leading technology companies and startups, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Samsung, and DeepFlare. Currently, I am working at Ernst & Young.

I am also actively engaged in the AI community, particularly with ML in PL, where I have been an organizer since 2020. Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy mountain hiking and motorization.
