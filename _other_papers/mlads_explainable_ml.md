During my internship at Microsoft Ireland, I led research on explainable machine learning methods that was presented at the internal Microsoft Machine Learning, AI and Data Science (MLADS) conference. This work focused on developing interpretable AI solutions for enterprise applications.

As the first intern at Microsoft Ireland to have a publication accepted at MLADS, this project demonstrated practical approaches to making machine learning models more transparent and understandable for business stakeholders.
